## About ##

Up until the time of writing this, Kiluket is one of the only projects of mine that I created because of recreation rather than to solve a problem. I made kiluket because I wanted to make a game via React. Thus, I made a simple game where the user is as character who must free lights from the grasp of the shadows possessing them. The mechanics for doing so is by the user relaying a pattern shown on a 4 button grid. Since the game relies on movement to encounter new shadows I made it optimally suitable for mobile by making it a progressive web app that works offline.

## Features ##

- Map of users location.
- Battling shadows by clicking on them within map then relaying correct sequence of buttons pressed by them.
- Shadows have variable difficulty in regards to being caught by their size which determines the numbers of buttons pressed, and a luck!
- Backpack that shows all the lights the user has caught with the option to free them.
- Quest book that shows users porgress in catching 1 of every light.
- Local storage to handle all data storage.
